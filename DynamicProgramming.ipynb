    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are problem solvers, always trying to devise the best way to solve a problem. People complete their task in different ways. Some solutions are effective but take time. While other solutions may be finished quickly, but the job is sloppy. The same thing can be said about programming code. The goal is to find both an optimal and time efficient solution that can limit the run time of the application and give the user more time to complete other tasks. An excellent method to complete this goal is **dynamic programming**. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic programming is a method created by Richard Bellman in the 1950s (Dreyfus 48). Dynamic Programming is mainly an **optimization** over plain **recursion**. Wherever there is a recursive solution that has repeated calls for some inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store that results of **subproblems**, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from  exponential to polynomial (“Dynamic Programming”). Since Dynamic Programming is optimizing problems by breaking down the algorithm into subproblems, it helps prevent each subproblem from being solved more than once which can be achieved by running a recursive function once and storing in memory this is called **memoization**. Finally, it is important to take a **bottom-up approach** rather than a **top-down approach** (Cormen 359).\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recursion and memoization both take a top down approach to solving the problem. This means that the problem is looked at as a whole and is broken down into pieces. Examining each piece to see how it makes a whole. Top-down can even be go further by breaking down the parts into subsubparts(Cormen 356). The main languages that also focus on top-down approach are: COBOL, Fortran, and C (\"Difference between Bottom-Up Model\").\n",

Instead of starting from the root, it starts from the bottom, the smallest variable types, and moves upward to the root. A good example of this is object-oriented languages; languages like C++, C#, and Java, all use the bottom-up approach because the object is always identified first (\"Difference between Bottom-Up Model\").\n",

For most people, top-down is a natural way of thinking which makes it more difficult for people to us the bottom-up process. In top-down decomposition takes place and bottom-up uses composition. There is less redunancy in the bottom-up approach because all parts must communicate. Top-down has all it's parts built seperately which means more redunancy and higher chances for the program to have communication errors. Finally, in the bottom-up approach, redundancy is further minimalized because it uses encapsulatin and data hiding (Cormen 365; \"Difference between Bottom-Up Model\"). "
