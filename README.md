# Dynamic-Programming-Project
## Authors
Bibek Roy, Danny Castaneda, and Tristan Wood

## General Information
This project was made by students at East Central University under the guidance of Dr. Nicholas Jacob, for the 2021 Fall Semester class of Operations Research. Each group was designated their own topic and followed specific guidelines to complete the project. 

## About This Project
In the chapter, we will go over dynamic programming by breaking it down into three categories: Recursion, memoization, and comparing the two different approaches, bottom-up and top-down. There are 5 examples, multiple images, and 10 problems that the reader can use to help improve their knowledge of dynammic programming. 

## Special Thanks
I want to thank the group as a whole for diligently working on this project and making it the best we can. 

Also, it is important to mention Dr. Jacob as a contributor because he verfied and reviewed the project to ensure that we, as a group, can make it with the best quality and factual as possible.
