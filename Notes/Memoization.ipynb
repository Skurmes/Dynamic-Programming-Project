    "  Prevents continous solving of the same recursive sub-problems by creating a 'sticky note' like save-state per inputs to be called for later calculations.This programming technique takes advantage of the CPU's cache and stores those more time-consuming calculations to later be used when called on throughout the solutions(\"Matrix Chain Multiplication Using\").\n",

    "  Memoization should only be used for recursive calculations that when requesting an output it will stay consistent each time calculations are executed. If not, the programmer would lose its effieceny and gained advantages as memoization would in the end take up more cpu cycle times in order to verify its cache stored data in verifying whether the output would be the same or not. Global variables would also grealty influence or break a memoized function. A different algorithm would be much more acceptable (Cormen 389).\n"
